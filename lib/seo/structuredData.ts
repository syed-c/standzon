// Common FAQ data for exhibition stands
export const COMMON_EXHIBITION_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How much does an exhibition stand cost?",
    answer: "Exhibition stand costs vary widely depending on size, complexity, and location. Basic modular stands start from $5,000, while custom-built stands can range from $15,000 to $200,000 or more. Factors include stand size, design complexity, materials, graphics, technology integration, and labor costs in different countries."
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I book an exhibition stand builder?",
    answer: "We recommend booking your exhibition stand builder 3-6 months before your event. Popular builders and prime exhibition dates book up quickly, especially for major trade shows. Early booking also allows more time for design development, approvals, and production."
  },
  {
    question: "What services do exhibition stand builders provide?",
    answer: "Professional exhibition stand builders offer comprehensive services including custom design, 3D visualization, construction, graphics production, furniture rental, AV integration, installation, dismantling, storage, and project management. Many also provide additional services like logistics, electrical work, and on-site support."
  },
  {
    question: "Do exhibition stand builders work internationally?",
    answer: "Yes, many exhibition stand builders work internationally or have partner networks worldwide. StandsZone connects you with local builders in over 20 countries, ensuring you get local expertise while maintaining quality standards. This approach often reduces costs and simplifies logistics."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between modular and custom exhibition stands?",
    answer: "Modular stands use pre-fabricated components that can be reconfigured for different events, making them cost-effective and reusable. Custom stands are built specifically for your brand and requirements, offering unique design possibilities but typically at higher cost. The choice depends on your budget, frequency of exhibitions, and branding needs."
