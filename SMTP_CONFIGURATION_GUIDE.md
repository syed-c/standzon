# SMTP Email Configuration Guide

## Current Status
✅ **OTP System Working** - The OTP verification system is now functional in development mode  
⚠️ **Email Delivery Issue** - SMTP authentication needs to be configured properly

## What's Working
- OTP generation and storage ✅
- OTP verification logic ✅
- Development mode with visible OTP codes ✅
- Registration flow with email verification ✅

## Email Configuration Issue
The SMTP configuration in `.env.local` has the correct settings:
```
SMTP_HOST="smtp.titan.email"
SMTP_PORT="465"
SMTP_SECURE="true"
SMTP_USER="support@standszone.com"
SMTP_PASSWORD="[CONFIGURED]"
```

However, there's an authentication error: `Invalid login: 535 5.7.8 Error: authentication failed`

## Solutions

### Option 1: Fix SMTP Password (Recommended)
1. Check that the actual SMTP password in `.env.local` is correct
2. Verify the email account credentials with your email provider
3. Ensure the email account allows SMTP access

### Option 2: Use Alternative Email Service
Consider switching to a more reliable email service:
- **SendGrid** - Easy setup with API key
- **AWS SES** - Reliable and scalable
- **Mailgun** - Developer-friendly

### Option 3: Continue with Development Mode
For now, the system works perfectly in development mode:
- Users see the OTP code directly in the interface
- No email delivery required for testing
- Full registration flow works

## Current User Experience
1. User enters email and requests OTP
2. System generates 6-digit code
3. **Development Mode**: OTP is displayed in a blue helper box
4. User copies the OTP and enters it for verification
5. Registration completes successfully

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: The system is ready for testing and development
2. **Production**: Configure proper SMTP credentials or switch email provider
3. **Optional**: Add email delivery status indicators

## Testing Instructions
1. Go to `/builder/register`
2. Fill out the registration form
3. On step 5, click "Send Verification Code"
4. Copy the OTP from the blue development helper box
5. Paste it into the verification field
6. Complete registration

The OTP verification system is now fully functional for development and testing purposes!
